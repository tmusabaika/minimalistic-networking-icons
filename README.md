## Usage in Cisco Packet Tracer

So far tried with Packet Tracer version 7.2 only but it should work for other versions as well.

### STEP 1:

Locate the folder at `C:\Program Files\Cisco Packet Tracer 7.2\art\Workspace\Logical .(Your directory structure may differ from mine).`

If you are on a 64-bit version of Windows and running the 32-bit version of Cisco Packet Tracer you may need to search in the `C:\Program Files(x86)\Cisco Packet Tracer 7.2\art\Workspace\Logical.`

### STEP 2:

Drop your symbols in there and ensure they are named exactly the same as the original files. For example routers are named "iRouter" switches are named "iSwitch" servers are named "iServer" and PCs are named "iWorkstation". That's it. Just restart Packet Tracer and every project will now reflect these new symbols.

Enjoy!
